1. Game Interface
 A way to interact with the game (e.g., simulate keyboardmouse inputs)
 Capture game state information (e.g., screenshots, game data)
2. State Preprocessor
 Convert game state information into a format suitable for the machine learning model
 Extract relevant features from the game state (e.g., playerpokemon stats, opponent's pokemon)
3. Action Space
 Define the actions the bot can take in the game (e.g., move, attack, use item)
 Map actions to game inputs (e.g., keyboardmouse inputs)
4. Reward Function
 Define a reward system to guide the bot's learning process
 Assign rewards for desirable actionsoutcomes (e.g., winning a battle, completing a level)
5. Machine Learning Model
 Choose a deep reinforcement learning algorithm (e.g., Q-learning, DQN, PPO)
 Train the model using the game state, actions, and rewards
6. MemoryExperience Replay
 Store experiences (game states, actions, rewards) for the model to learn from
 Implement experience replay to improve learning efficiency
7. ExplorationExploitation Strategy
 Balance exploration (trying new actions) and exploitation (using learned knowledge)
 Implement a strategy (e.g., epsilon-greedy, entropy-based) to control exploration
8. Training Loop
 Create a loop to train the model using the game interface, state preprocessor, and reward function
 Monitor performance and adjust hyperparameters as needed
9. TestingEvaluation
 Test the trained model in the game environment
 Evaluate performance using metrics (e.g., win rate, average reward)
Let's focus on building the Game Interface first. We'll need to
Choose a library to interact with the game (e.g., pyautogui, opencv)
Develop a way to capture game state information (e.g., screenshots, game data)
